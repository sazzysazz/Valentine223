                                Hey TiDa❤️,
                                As Valentine's Day approaches, I couldn't help but express how much your presence brightens my days. Though we might be in a "situationship," I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the special connection we share.
                                Your smile, laughter, and the way you make ordinary moments extraordinary have not gone unnoticed. Whether we're sharing conversations or just being in the same space, there's a warmth that I cherish.
                                So, on this Valentine's Day, I want to wish you joy, laughter, and all the good vibes. Whether or not we navigate the typical romantic route, know that your presence matters a lot to me.
                                Cheers to the unique journey we're on, and hoping this Valentine's Day brings a little extra brightness to your world. 
                                <br><br>
